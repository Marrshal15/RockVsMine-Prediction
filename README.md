# RockVsMine-Prediction
Linear Regression Prediction Model

This is a simple Linear Regression Model to predict dependency of a Variable.
The code collects, preprocesses the data which is a sonar reading of a submarine.
Then the data is fit to a Linear Regression Model and trained to predict whether the sonar detected a Rock or an Underwater mine.
